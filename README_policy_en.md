# ðŸ”’ OnceHuman Tools Usage Policy

## About the Program

**OnceHuman Tools** is auxiliary software developed to enhance user experience, personalization, and monitoring of in-game processes. It does not violate game rules, interfere with gameplay, or provide unfair advantages to users. The program complies with all aspects outlined in the *Once Human* Terms of Use and is completely safe.

## 1. Purpose and Scope of Application

**OnceHuman Tools** is intended solely to improve the user experience through monitoring and personalization of in-game processes. **OnceHuman Tools** strictly adheres to all legal aspects and terms of use outlined in the license agreement of the *Once Human* game. The program is intended for use only within the boundaries that do not violate the rules and regulations established by *Once Human*.

## 2. Compliance with Terms of Use and Legal Security

**OnceHuman Tools** was created in full compliance with the [Terms of Use](https://protocol.unisdk.easebar.com/release/latest_v487.html) of *Once Human*, ensuring safe and lawful use. The program does not interfere with the game code, does not read data from RAM, and operates exclusively at the level of interaction with the user interface.

### Image Replacement and Personalization: Legal Context

Users have the right to personalize **OnceHuman Tools** and use their own content in accordance with the legal norms of various jurisdictions, which confirm their right to modify and manage their data stored on their personal devices. For example:

- In the European Union, according to [Article 20 of the GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-20-gdpr/), users have the right to access and manage their data, including the right to portability and storage of information on local devices without restrictions from third parties.
- In the United States, privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) allow users to store, modify, and use their own data, including any digital materials created on their devices, as long as this data is not shared publicly.
- In Russia, the Personal Data Law (Federal Law 152) provides that users can manage and store their personal data on their devices, provided it does not infringe on third-party rights and is used for personal needs. Additionally, Article 23 of the Russian Constitution guarantees the right to privacy, which implies the freedom to store and manage data created by the user.
- In China, the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) grants users the right to store and manage personal data obtained during the use of various programs and devices, provided it is stored locally and not shared with third parties.

#### 2.1 Screenshots as User Data

In accordance with data retention and modification standards, such as GDPR in the EU, CCPA in the USA, Federal Law 152 in Russia, and PIPL in China, **screenshots taken by the user are considered their personal data**, as they are stored on their device. Since screenshots are stored locally, any modifications or replacements of this data do not infringe third-party rights and do not fall under the game content modification rules.

The *Once Human* policy does not restrict modification of images taken by the user on their device, provided they are not altered on the game server side or made publicly available. Notably, **all screenshots and photos taken in the game are stored on the user's computer without protection against modification or replacement**, confirming that they are personal data and are not covered by the game content protection rules.

#### 2.2 Legality of Using User Content

Under provisions such as [Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights](https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf), personal data and files on users' devices are protected from interference as long as they are not shared publicly and do not infringe the rights of third parties.

This is further supported by the fact that the *Once Human* policy does not prohibit the use of personalized images for internal application within the user's ecosystem, provided they do not alter the original game files or functionality.

## 3. Monitoring and Tracking Function: Distinguishing from Unfair Advantages

**OnceHuman Tools** includes tools for monitoring in-game events based on OCR technology (optical character and image recognition), which recognizes on-screen data and reacts to it similarly to a player.

### 3.1 Monitoring and Notifications

The program's functions include tracking game events, such as raid starts, resource status changes, or base attack alerts. These functions do not modify the game process and are intended to enhance convenience in monitoring and managing resources.

### 3.2 No Direct Interference in Game Process

The monitoring and notification tools of **OnceHuman Tools** work exclusively at the level of reading information from the screen, without directly interacting with or modifying game data. This places the program on par with utilities like screen calibration tools, system parameter monitors, or visibility enhancement software.

### 3.3 Security and Absence of Gameplay Automation

The program does not perform actions unavailable to ordinary users. Monitoring functions do not provide a competitive advantage and do not violate Clause 4.5a of the *Once Human* Terms of Use, as they do not alter the game process, hack files, or use third-party resources.

## 4. Legal Justification for Using OnceHuman Tools

**OnceHuman Tools** fully complies with legal requirements:

- **User Data Privacy**: All images and data generated by the program are stored locally and are not transferred to third parties, in accordance with GDPR requirements and similar regulations.
- **Legitimate Use**: The program does not provide a competitive advantage and functions solely as a tool for personalization and monitoring, without modifying game files or interfering with game memory.

## Conclusion

**OnceHuman Tools** is legitimate and safe software that:

- Does not alter game files or interfere with game memory.
- Operates at the user interface level, reading and displaying information.
- Aims to improve monitoring, personalization, and enhance the user experience without disrupting game balance or creating security risks.

This document confirms that **OnceHuman Tools** complies with legal norms and terms of use and operates within the permissible boundaries for monitoring and personalization software.

### Protection Against Changes in *Once Human* Policy

To close potential loopholes, we note that the game developers may attempt to change their terms of use to restrict the use of **OnceHuman Tools** and block its functionality. However, any policy change aimed at prohibiting safe software use may violate the following legal standards:

1. **Principle of Legality**. According to international norms, changes to terms of use cannot introduce retroactive restrictions that would infringe previously established user rights (e.g., consumer protection laws that guard against unreasonable changes in terms of use).

2. **Prohibition of Limiting Personal Rights**. Laws such as GDPR, CCPA, Federal Law 152, and PIPL protect users' rights to access, modify, and manage personal data as long as it is stored locally and not publicly shared. Imposing restrictions that violate this principle can be legally challenged.

3. **Protection Against Anti-Competitive Practices**. Introducing changes aimed at eliminating legitimate third-party tools like **OnceHuman Tools** may be considered anti-competitive behavior and a violation of antitrust laws, especially if these changes substantially limit the programâ€™s functionality.

In conclusion, any changes in *Once Human*'s policy aimed at restricting personalization and the use of third-party monitoring tools may be seen as a violation of users' rights to manage their personal data and their freedom of choice within the gameâ€™s ecosystem, which would be a violation of laws across various jurisdictions.
